# ü™ù Hookkey

**Hookkey** is a simple, lightweight keylogger built **for educational purposes only**.  
This project was inspired by Acrylic (https://youtu.be/ZnAhKwHLWd4) demonstrating a keylogger setup using a USB Rubber Ducky.

## üéØ Why I Made This

I created **Hookkey** after seeing a YouTube video showcasing a hardware-based keylogger using a USB Rubber Ducky. I was curious to explore the concept purely with software and minimal payloads without using a USB rubber ducky (because i can't afford one).

The goal of this project is to send a payload script as short as possible with the help of pastebin.com,to help others understand the basics of how keyloggers work and encourage ethical security research.

## ‚ú® Difference From the Video

In the original video, the creator:
- Used a **USB Rubber Ducky** to run a pre-written payload.

With **Hookkey**:
- ‚úÖ **Software-only:** No special hardware is required.
- ‚úÖ **Smaller payload:** The injection code is minimal ‚Äî simple enough to write manually.
- ‚úÖ **More transparent:** Easier to read and understand so you can learn.
- ‚úÖ **Keylogger-focused:** Although in the video his logger can read mouse movements and other inputs, this logger can **only read keystrokes**, making it easy for anyone to modify this code and use it for their own learning.

## üß† How It Works

**Hookkey** works by capturing keyboard inputs and storing them into a log file for review.  
Here‚Äôs a high-level overview of the process:
1. **Keyboard hook:** Hookkey sets up a listener for all keyboard presses.
2. **Logging keys:** Every key pressed is appended to a log file.
3. **Trigger on 300 keystrokes:** Once the log file reaches **300 keystrokes**, the contents of `log.txt` will automatically be sent to your specified **Discord webhook**.
4. **Data review:** You can review the keystrokes in the local log file or on your Discord channel.
5. **Simple payload:** The code to set this up is small and easy to reproduce manually ‚Äî perfect for educational purposes.

This structure allows you to understand how a keylogger intercepts and records keystrokes without relying on specialized hardware.
